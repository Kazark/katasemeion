# Κατασημεῖον
### A markdown-inspired markup language for formatting Biblical texts

The name is a nerd joke: **κατα-** can be translated *down*; **σημεῖον** can be
translated *mark*. This is not to say that this is the actual Greek word for
Markdown.

I have just begun this project. While in college, I create a mashup of scripts
that I used to convert a easy-to-write XMML format into HTML or LaTeX so I
could pretty-print my translations of Biblical books without having to use a
WYSIWIG editor. I prefer to live in my native habitat, Vim.

Then I started using StackOverflow, and learned Markdown. Markdown grew and grew
on me. Finally, I've decided it's time to take the ideas that I used in my XML
hacks from before and convert them into something Markdown-like.

It remains to be seen how far I get on this project.
